# Data Structures in C

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is a collection of simple and clear implementations of some of the most important data structures in the C programming language. It was made as part of my learning journey and can be helpful for anyone who is just getting started with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

Each folder contains code that focuses on one specific type of data structure. You'll find basic operations, useful comments in the code, and examples that show how each data structure behaves.

## 📁 What's Inside?

### 📌 Array list  
This section shows how to work with arrays in C. You'll find:
- Static array implementation
- Adding elements to the array
- Deleting elements from any position
- Displaying the entire array
Arrays are the simplest data structure and a good starting point for beginners.

### 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST)  
A binary search tree is a special kind of tree where each node has at most two children, and the left child is always smaller than the parent, while the right child is larger.  
In this folder, you'll find:
- How to build a BST
- Insert, search, and delete nodes
- Inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal
- Examples and test cases

### 🔗 Linked List  
Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t store elements in a continuous memory block. They’re flexible and can grow or shrink as needed.  
This folder contains:
- Singly linked list implementation
- Functions to insert elements at the beginning, middle, and end
- Deleting nodes from different positions
- Traversing the list to print its contents

### 🌀 Stack & Queue  
Two very important data structures that are used in many algorithms and real-world problems.  
You’ll find:
- Stack implementation using both arrays and linked lists (LIFO – Last In First Out)
- Queue implementation using arrays and linked lists (FIFO – First In First Out)
- Push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, and display functions
