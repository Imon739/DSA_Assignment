A stack is a collection of elements where the last item added is the first one to be removed, following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Think of it like a stack of plates—only the top plate can be taken off first.
Common operations include:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack. If no more elements can be added, this results in an overflow.

Pop: Removes the topmost element. If the stack is empty and a pop is attempted, it leads to an underflow.

This structure is especially useful in scenarios like managing function calls or undo operations, where the most recent action is dealt with firs


A queue is a structure that operates on the principle of First In, First Out (FIFO). This ensures that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. A typical real-world example is a line of people waiting for a service—those who arrive first will be served before those who arrive later.

The main difference between a queue and a stack is how elements are removed. In a stack, the most recently added item is removed first, following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) method. On the other hand, a queue removes the element that has been waiting the longest, following the FIFO rule.
