A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (node) in the list is connected to the next by pointers.
1.	Singly Linked List:
In a singly linked list, each node contains two parts: the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to null, indicating the end of the list. The first node in the list is referred to as the head. The head is not a separate node; it is just a pointer to the first node. If the list is empty, the head points to null.
2.	Doubly Linked List:
In a doubly linked list, each node has three parts: the data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. Like in a singly linked list, the last node points to null. The head of the list is a pointer to the first node, and if the list is empty, the head points to null.
Both types of linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and provide flexibility in terms of size and memory management. However, doubly linked lists have the advantage of allowing traversal in both directions at the cost of extra memory for the additional pointer.
